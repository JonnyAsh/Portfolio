											<h2>Secure Software Development</h2>
									
											<h3>What I have learned in this module:</h3>
											
											<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
											<li>Identify and manage security risks as part of a software development project.</li>
											<li>Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies,
											 tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them.</li>
											<li>Design and develop/adapt computer programs and to produce a solution that meets the design brief and critically evaluate solutions that are produced.</li>
											<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment,
	 										adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li></p>
											</ul>
											<br>
											
											
											<h3>Seminars</h3>
											<p>Throughout the Programme, we are tasked to do multiple group and individual 
											exercises, projects, and assignments. The artefacts' page documents these
											tasks and highlights key outcomes. </p>

											<h3>Collaborative Discussions</h3>
											<p>As this module consists of group work, this page records the meetings' minutes as well as discussions
											 involving tasks, exercises, projects, and assignments.</p>

											<h3>Blog</h3>
											<p>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.
												Select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions
												and write a 300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside.</p>

											<h3>Testing</h3>
											<p>The aim of these exercises was to investigate the different types of linters and examine the ways
												in which they support decure and effective coding. These included Pylint, Flake8, McCabe, and Bandit.
												I really enjoyed doing these tasks as I had never understood the relevance of them. However, I have found them 
												to be really useful as I can now make better code by reducing errors and complexity as well as scanning python for security vulnerabilites (i.e,. password in source code) via <a href="https://resources.hacware.com/bandit-security-scan-for-python-code/"> Bandit</a></p>

											<a href="docs\SSD docs\Linters.pdf"> Linters: Pylint, flack8, McCabe</a><br> 
											<br>
											<p>This is an example of using Bandit to see if there are any vulnerabilites in an authentication programme.</p>
											<img src="docs\SSD docs\auth.py code bandit.png" alt="auth.py"><br>
											<br>
											<p>This was the output: no issues identified as passwords were hashed and salted using <a href="https://techmonger.github.io/4/secure-passwords-werkzeug/"> Werkzeug.secuity</a></p>

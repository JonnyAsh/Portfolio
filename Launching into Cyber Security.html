											<h3>Reflection</h3>
											<p>The Launching into Cyber Security module was an interesting learning curve. The module lasted 12 weeks with weekly units on different cyber security aspects such as Unified Modelling Language, threat models, software vulnerabilities, and secure databases to name a few as well as lectures and seminars. There were components which consisted of forum discussions on personally selected cyber security-related topics such as GDPR, Wireguard VPN, and Cloud Firewalls. These discussions allowed students to engage with other classmates on new and pertinent issues in the cyber security field. The summaries can be viewed in the Summary Post sections above.<br>
												<br>
												
The module also provided access to a range of courses to improve studentsâ€™ competencies in Python, GitHub, Linux, MySQL, and HTML which could be used to set up GitHub e-Portfolios and the coding exercise in the final project. The final project consisted of two parts. The report investigated threats and protection of an appointment and scheduling system for a medical centre, and then code a programme that would mitigate a reported threat.<br>
<br>												
I really enjoyed learning about the many aspects of cyber security from a theoretical and practical perspective. Although, my favourite aspect was the technical elements such as UML drawings and coding as these were relatively new for me. Whenever I learned a new code or language, I would imitate it using my newly purchased raspberry Pi 4. For example, I learned to use Linux CLI to operate the Debian-based Raspberry Pi operating system through SSH and install a MySQL server to replicate a patient database for my final project.<br>
<br>												
On a downside, I did struggle with the Python Object-orientated programming task. I had learnt Python elements such as strings, lists, and loops, yet I could not fully comprehend a more complex programme of classes, modules, and attributes. I understood them individually but not collectively. Despite this, I still learned a great amount doing the Python task; and as I acquire more experience with other languages, I am positive that I will become more competent in object-orientated programming.<br>
<br>												
It been great learning many cyber-related knowledge and technical skills. I feel I am progressing at a steady rate, and already colleagues and friends have asked me for advice and help regarding their information and cyber security. I am ready for the next module!

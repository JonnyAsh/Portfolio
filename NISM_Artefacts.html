											<h3>Seminar 2: DREAD Analysis</h3>
											
											<p>As I presented the DREAD analysis to the seminar, I felt our teamâ€™s analysis of the security threats and mitigations was very good; 
											 however, I do feel that we could have covered slightly more mitigation strategies such as using a VPN. Feedback from team members and tutor was positive though.</p></b>

											<h4> Learning outcomes</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Identify and analyse security risks and vulnerabilities in IT network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.</li>
												<li>Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including Internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues.</li>	
												</br>
												</br>

											<h3>Scanning exercise</h3>
											<p>This exercise tasked us to use basic networking utilties such as Traceroute, Nmap, MTR, and Dig to scan a vulnerable web site and to anwser questions about hops, location, and other records.
											I thoroughly enjoyed using these utlities as it allowed me to use a VM, and different operating systems: Kali Linux, Windows.
											I encountered issues installing Kali Linux on Windows 11's VirtualBox as well as using the networking utilities properly due to inconsistent results.
											Overall, it was a great learnning experience which I will take into the final project.</p>

												<h3>Seminar 3: TCP/IP v ISO/OSI</h3>
												<p>I had known the OSI model before during my networking study, but I was unaware of the history and significance of the TCP/IP versus ISO/OSI debate. It was fascinating to know that
													the TCP/IP standard was developed by ARPANET which helped to develop the World Wide Web.</p>

											<h3>Design document</h3>
											<p>This was Team 3's first collaboration project, and it was a valuable learning experience due to different time zones, cultures, and experience.
											 We organised a WhatsApp group and and a shared Google Drive which allowed the team to discuss and collaborate at any given time. Although there were initial teething problems with 
											 expectations and communication, we managed to submit our team's Design Document five days before project deadline.</p>

											<h3>Seminar 4: penetration testing tools evaluation</h3>
									
											<p>I had used a few of these tools before in a personal capacity such as Nessus; however, other tools including Jawfish and Burp suite were relatively new. To complete this evaluation, I researched each new one to get a better understanding of their capabilities,
											 and function. Although I am excited to to further explore and use these applications for my upcoming project, I am still unsure how to use them effectively.</p>

													to see everyone's contribution and view as it helped to alter my initial perspective.

											<h3>Final project</h3>
											<p>This project is an executive summary of the finished evalution based on the design document.</p>

											<a href="docs/Final Executive Summary.pdf"> Executive Summary</a><br>

											<p> I thoroughly enjoyed using Kali Linux tools such as Nikto, OWASP ZAP, Waf00f, and Nmap to scan
												the vulnerable website. Although, I did not exploit the vulnerabilites nor use any cracking tools,
												it was satisfying to see these pentest tools work. I am not fully confident in using the more sophisticated 
												Kali Linux applications; however, I plan to attend an ethical hacker bootcamp to improve on these newly found skills. </p>
